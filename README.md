# ard-nano-thermometer-4digit-display
An entrance level thermometer project for PCB design that includes Arduino Nano as a microcontroller, LM35 sensor,  4 digit 7 segment display and if needed, there is a LM7805 voltage regulator with 5V output if there is a need to use I added a connector which can supply max 2 device.
